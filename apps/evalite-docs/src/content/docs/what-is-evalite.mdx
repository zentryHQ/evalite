title: What Is Evalite?
---

import { Aside, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Evalite runs your evals locally. Evals are like tests, but for AI-powered apps.

So Evalite is like Jest or Vitest, but for apps that use AI.

Here are the headlines:

- Lets you write evals in `.eval.ts` files.
- Runs a local server on `localhost` with live reload
- Lets you capture traces, build custom scorers, and much more
- Based on Vite & Vitest, so you can use all the same tools (mocks, lifecycle hooks, `vite.config.ts`) you're used to

## What Are Evals?

**Evals are to AI-powered apps what tests are to regular apps**. They're a way to check that your app is working as expected.

Normal tests give you a pass or fail metric. **Evals give you a score from 0-100** based on how well your app is performing.

Instead of `.test.ts` files, Evalite uses `.eval.ts` files. They look like this:

```ts
// my-eval.eval.ts

import { evalite } from "evalite";
import { Levenshtein } from "autoevals";

evalite("My Eval", {
  // A set of data to test
  data: async () => {
    return [{ input: "Hello", expected: "Hello World!" }];
  },
  // The task to perform, usually to call a LLM.
  task: async (input) => {
    return input + " World!";
  },
  // Some methods to score the eval
  scorers: [
    // For instance, Levenshtein distance measures
    // the similarity between two strings
    Levenshtein,
  ],
});
```

In the code above, we have:

- `data`: A dataset to test
- `task`: The task to perform
- `scorers`: Methods to score the eval

These are the core elements of an eval.

## Why Does Evalite Exist?

There are plenty of eval runners out there. But most of them are also bundled with a cloud service.

Evalite is different. It's **local-only**. It runs on your machine, and you stay in complete control of your data.

This means no friction, no sign-off, and no vendor lock-in. Just you, your code, and your evals.

And, of course, it's completely open source.
